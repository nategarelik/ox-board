## 6. Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack (Optimal)

**Frontend**:

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) ✅
- **UI**: React 18 + TypeScript (strict) ✅
- **Audio**: Tone.js 15.1.22 (AudioWorklet architecture) ✅
- **Gestures**: MediaPipe Hands 0.10.21 ✅
- **State**: Zustand (lightweight, proven) ✅
- **Visualization**: Three.js (3D viz), WaveSurfer.js 7.10.3 ✅
- **PWA**: Next-PWA, Workbox ⚠️ (needs integration)

**Backend** (Spec 003):

- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) ⚠️ (not started)
- **Stem Separation**: Demucs 4.0.0 ⚠️ (not started)
- **Queue**: Celery + Redis ⚠️ (not started)
- **YouTube**: yt-dlp ⚠️ (not started)
- **Storage**: Local filesystem + optional S3 ⚠️ (not started)

**Deployment**:

- **Frontend**: Vercel (recommended) or Netlify
- **Backend**: Railway (GPU support) or Render
- **Database**: Redis (job queue) + optional PostgreSQL (user data)
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network or Cloudflare

### UI Architecture: Dual Mode Strategy

**Decision**: **KEEP BOTH UI modes** with feature flag toggle

**Classic UI** (`StemPlayerDashboard.tsx`):

- Modern gradient design
- Full-featured interface
- Business features (subscriptions, analytics)
- Default mode for new users

**Terminal UI** (`TerminalApp.tsx`):

- Retro CRT aesthetic
- Green-on-black color scheme
- Scanline and flicker effects
- Same functionality, different presentation
- Appeal to nostalgic/retro audience

**Toggle Implementation**:

- Bottom-right corner button
- User preference stored in localStorage
- Instant mode switching
- No data loss on switch

**Rationale**: Both modes appeal to different user segments. Terminal UI is a unique differentiator.

### Audio Architecture: Proven Path

**Decision**: **Keep `stemPlaybackEngine.ts` as single source of truth**

**Rationale**:

- 390 lines, well-tested, production-ready
- AudioWorklet architecture (sub-10ms latency)
- Proven stable in current implementation
- No need for multiple competing processors

**Delete**:

- `stemProcessor.ts` (919 lines, unused despite tests)
- `optimizedStemProcessor.ts` (974 lines, experimental)

**Future Enhancement Path**:

- If analysis needed, integrate Essentia.js into `stemPlaybackEngine.ts`
- If optimization needed, refactor within existing file
- Avoid multiple competing implementations

### Gesture Architecture: Production Code Only

**Decision**: **Keep `recognition.ts` as single gesture system**

**Rationale**:

- 994 lines, battle-tested
- MediaPipe integration proven
- 60 FPS performance achieved
- Kalman filtering working

**Delete**:

- `optimizedRecognition.ts` (657 lines, experimental, 0 imports)

### State Management: Dual Store Strategy

**Decision**: **Keep BOTH stores for different purposes**

**Stores**:

1. `stemPlayerStore.ts` (260 lines) - Basic playback state
2. `enhancedDjStoreWithGestures.ts` (1,159 lines) - DJ features + gestures

**Delete**:

- `enhancedStemPlayerStore.ts` (1,064 lines, completely unused)
- `app/stores/slices/` (4 files, orphaned)

**Rationale**: Different stores serve different features, both in use.

   ```

2. **Job Polling**:

   ```
   Frontend polls GET /api/jobs/{jobId} every 2s → Status updates → Complete/Error
   ```

3. **Stem Caching**:
   ```
   Stems downloaded → IndexedDB cache → Offline playback
   ```

**Implementation Priority**: Week 1-4 of Phase 1

### Offline/PWA Integration

   - Show install button in header
   - Track installation analytics

**Implementation Priority**: Week 5 of Phase 1

### Gesture-Audio Integration

**Current**: Both systems work independently
**Target**: Seamless gesture → audio control

**Integration Pattern**:

```
Hand Movement → MediaPipe (60 FPS) → Kalman Filter → Gesture Recognition
  ↓
Gesture-Stem Mapper → State Update → Audio Engine → <50ms latency
