# üì¶ UI Archive

This directory contains **ARCHIVED UI IMPLEMENTATIONS** that are not currently active but preserved for reference.

**Status**: Can be adapted for Terminal UI

## Why Archived?

These interfaces were archived to:

1. **Simplify the codebase** - One UI paradigm
2. **Focus development** - Terminal UI only
3. **Preserve work** - Keep code for reference
4. **Enable reuse** - Extract components as needed

## Reusing Archived Code

To extract functionality from archived UIs:

1. **Identify the component** you need
2. **Copy relevant code** to active directories
3. **Adapt styling** to Terminal aesthetic
4. **Test integration** with Terminal UI

## Component Status

## File Count

- **professional-dj/**: 17 components
- **stem-player/**: 8 components
- **visualizations/**: 4 components
- **Total**: 29 archived components

## Future Considerations

These archived UIs could be:

- Converted to Terminal aesthetic
- Used as mobile app interfaces
- Offered as alternative themes
- Open-sourced separately

**Remember**: Only the Terminal UI is active. These are for reference only.
