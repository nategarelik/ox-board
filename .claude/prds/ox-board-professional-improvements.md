# PRD: ox-board Professional Improvements

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines a comprehensive 7-day transformation plan to elevate ox-board from its current prototype state to a production-ready, professional-grade DJ platform. The plan addresses 22 open GitHub issues, critical browser compatibility errors, architectural debt, and missing professional development standards. Upon completion, ox-board will be a showcase-worthy application suitable for real-world deployment at events, with zero runtime errors, professional code organization, and industry-standard development practices.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Problems
1. **Production-Breaking Errors**: The application has critical errors preventing basic functionality:
   - AudioContext initialization violates browser autoplay policies
   - React lazy loading crashes prevent component rendering
   - SSR hydration mismatches cause UI inconsistencies

2. **Unprofessional Development Practices**:
   - Poor commit hygiene (single-letter commit messages)
   - No automated testing infrastructure
   - Missing CI/CD pipeline
   - No error monitoring or recovery mechanisms

3. **Architectural Debt**:
   - Monolithic 269-line page.tsx file
   - No separation of concerns
   - Missing service layer abstraction
   - Lack of proper component organization

4. **Incomplete Features**:
   - 22 open GitHub issues blocking MVP completion
   - Missing tutorial system for user onboarding
   - No keyboard shortcuts for accessibility
   - Absent performance monitoring

### Why This Is Important Now
- **Credibility Gap**: Claims of "MVP 100% complete" with 22 open issues damages developer credibility
- **Unusable State**: Critical errors prevent the application from functioning in production browsers
- **Technical Interviews**: Current state would fail technical assessment for professional opportunities
- **Event Readiness**: Cannot be deployed for actual Theta Chi or other DJ events without fixes
