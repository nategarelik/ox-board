# PRD: Ox-Board Gesture-Controlled DJ Platform

## Executive Summary

Ox-Board will be transformed from its current minimal state into a revolutionary gesture-controlled DJ platform that combines cutting-edge hand tracking technology with professional audio mixing capabilities. This platform will enable DJs to perform without physical equipment, using natural hand gestures to control music mixing, effects, and visual performances. The system will support both solo and collaborative DJ sessions, making it ideal for both professional performances and social music experiences.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Traditional DJ equipment is expensive ($2,000-$10,000+), bulky, difficult to transport, and requires significant technical knowledge to operate. This creates barriers for:
- Aspiring DJs who cannot afford professional equipment
- Venues with limited space for DJ setups
- Social gatherings where music mixing would enhance the experience
- People with mobility limitations who find traditional equipment challenging

### Why is this important now?
- **Technology Maturity**: Hand tracking (MediaPipe) and browser-based audio synthesis (Web Audio API/Tone.js) have reached production-ready quality
- **Market Demand**: Post-pandemic surge in virtual events and home entertainment
