## Executive Summary

OX Board MVP is a browser-based gesture-controlled DJ platform that enables music mixing through webcam-captured hand movements. The MVP focuses on delivering core DJ functionality with YouTube and SoundCloud integration, allowing users to mix tracks without physical equipment. Target completion is immediate (same day) with emphasis on functionality over visual polish.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
DJ equipment costs $500-5000, creating a significant barrier to entry for aspiring DJs and casual users who want to mix music at parties or events. Additionally, learning traditional DJ equipment is intimidating and time-consuming for beginners.

### Why is this important now?
- The existing codebase has gesture detection working but lacks actual DJ functionality
- Theta Chi fraternity needs a working solution for upcoming events
- No competitors exist in the gesture-controlled DJ space
- Browser technology (MediaPipe, Web Audio API) has matured to enable this

## User Stories

### Primary Persona: College DJ (Nate)
**Context:** Theta Chi member who DJs at fraternity parties
**Pain Points:** Can't afford equipment, limited space in dorm
**User Journey:**
1. Opens OX Board on laptop connected to party speakers
2. Searches and loads tracks from YouTube/SoundCloud
3. Uses hand gestures to mix between two songs
4. Applies effects during transitions
5. Keeps the party going for 2+ hours

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Can load tracks within 10 seconds
- Gesture latency < 50ms
- No audio dropouts during 2-hour set

### Secondary Persona: Beginner DJ (Maria)
**Context:** Complete beginner wanting to learn DJ skills
**Pain Points:** Overwhelmed by traditional equipment
**User Journey:**
1. Opens tutorial on first visit
2. Learns basic gestures in 5 minutes
3. Practices with demo tracks
4. Successfully mixes first two songs
5. Shares mix with friends

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tutorial completion in < 10 minutes
- Successfully mix 2 songs on first session
- Clear visual feedback for gestures

## Success Criteria

### Day 1 (MVP Launch)
- [ ] Load and play tracks from YouTube/SoundCloud
- [ ] Mix between two tracks using gestures
- [ ] Apply at least 3 effects
- [ ] Complete tutorial in < 10 minutes
- [ ] Achieve < 50ms gesture latency

### Week 1
- [ ] 100 successful mixing sessions
- [ ] 80% tutorial completion rate
- [ ] Average session length > 20 minutes
- [ ] Zero critical bugs reported

### Month 1
- [ ] 1,000 registered users

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Browser security requires HTTPS for camera access
- CORS limitations for some streaming services
- Web Audio API processing limits
- MediaPipe requires good lighting conditions

### Resource Constraints
