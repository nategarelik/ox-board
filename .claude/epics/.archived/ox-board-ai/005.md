# Task: Implement extended gesture vocabulary for stem control

## Description
Extend the existing MediaPipe gesture recognition system with new gestures specifically designed for stem control, providing intuitive hand-based control over individual track elements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extended gesture vocabulary with 7+ new stem-specific gestures
- [ ] High-accuracy recognition (>98%) for each gesture
- [ ] Natural gesture mapping (peace sign = drums, rock horns = bass)
- [ ] Gesture training mode for user calibration
- [ ] Visual feedback overlay for gesture confirmation
- [ ] Haptic feedback via browser vibration API
- [ ] Gesture conflict resolution and error handling

## Technical Details
- Extend existing MediaPipe Hands integration with new gesture classifiers
- Implement STEM_GESTURES mapping:
  - PEACE_SIGN: drums toggle
  - ROCK_HORNS: bass toggle
  - OK_SIGN: melody toggle
  - SHAKA: vocals toggle
  - PINCH_PULL: stem volume adjust
  - MIDDLE_FINGER: loop start
  - PEACE_ROTATE: loop length select
- Add gesture confidence scoring and validation
- Implement adaptive calibration per user
- Create visual gesture feedback overlay

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing MediaPipe Hands integration
- [ ] Gesture recognition pipeline
- [ ] UI overlay system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All stem gestures implemented and tested
- [ ] Gesture accuracy meets >98% threshold
- [ ] Training mode functional
- [ ] Visual and haptic feedback working
- [ ] User testing with gesture validation
