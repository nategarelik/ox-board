# Task: Integrate stem separation pipeline with Demucs/Spleeter

## Description
Implement the core stem separation pipeline that takes an audio file and separates it into 4 distinct stems (drums, bass, melody, vocals). This is the foundational component that enables all stem-based features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] StemSeparationService class implemented
- [ ] Integration with Demucs v4 model (primary) and Spleeter (fallback)
- [ ] Support for WebAssembly or cloud API processing
- [ ] Audio preprocessing pipeline (format conversion, normalization)
- [ ] 4-stem output (drums, bass, melody, vocals) with SDR > 7dB quality
- [ ] Processing time < 5 seconds per 3-minute track
- [ ] Error handling for unsupported formats or processing failures

## Technical Details
- Implement StemSeparationService with methods:
  - preprocessAudio(file): Convert to suitable format (WAV, 44.1kHz)
  - separateStems(audio): Process through Demucs/Spleeter
  - validateStemQuality(stems): Ensure output meets quality thresholds
- Support both WebAssembly (local) and cloud API processing modes
- Handle audio format conversion and sample rate normalization
- Implement progress callbacks for long-running operations

## Dependencies
- [ ] Demucs v4 model or Spleeter integration
- [ ] WebAssembly runtime or cloud compute API
- [ ] Audio format conversion utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit tests for all separation scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Integration tests with sample tracks
- [ ] Documentation updated
