# Task: Create stem visualization UI components

## Description
Design and implement sophisticated visualization components for the 4-stem player, including color-coded waveforms, real-time spectrum analyzers, and visual feedback for active/muted stems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 4-lane waveform display per deck (drums, bass, melody, vocals)
- [ ] Color-coded stem visualization (drums=red, bass=blue, melody=green, vocals=yellow)
- [ ] Real-time spectrum analyzer per stem
- [ ] Visual feedback for active/muted/soloed stems
- [ ] Playhead synchronization across all stems
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Performance optimization for 60fps rendering

## Technical Details
- Create StemVisualizationComponent with 4 synchronized waveform displays
- Implement real-time spectrum analysis using Web Audio API AnalyserNode
- Use Canvas or WebGL for high-performance waveform rendering
- Color-code stems consistently throughout the interface
- Add visual indicators for stem states (playing, muted, soloed)
- Implement shared playhead across all stem lanes
- Optimize rendering pipeline for smooth 60fps performance

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: 4-stem player architecture
- [ ] Existing UI component system
- [ ] Web Audio API analyzer nodes

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All visualization components implemented
- [ ] Color coding consistent and accessible
- [ ] Performance tests confirming 60fps
- [ ] Responsive design validated
- [ ] Integration with stem player complete
