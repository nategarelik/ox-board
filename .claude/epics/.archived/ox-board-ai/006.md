# Task: Build gesture-to-stem control mapping system

## Description
Create the bridge between recognized gestures and stem audio controls, enabling real-time manipulation of individual stems through hand gestures with sub-10ms latency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GestureToStemMapper class implemented
- [ ] Real-time gesture-to-audio mapping with <10ms latency
- [ ] Context-aware gesture interpretation
- [ ] Gesture state management (press/hold/release)
- [ ] Simultaneous multi-gesture support
- [ ] Gesture shortcuts and combinations
- [ ] Fallback touch/keyboard controls

## Technical Details
- Implement GestureToStemMapper connecting gesture recognition to stem controls
- Handle gesture state transitions (start, hold, end)
- Map continuous gestures (pinch) to parameter changes (volume)
- Implement gesture context awareness (which deck is active)
- Support simultaneous gestures for complex operations
- Add gesture combination support (two-hand operations)
- Maintain low-latency audio parameter updates

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: 4-stem player architecture
- [ ] Task 005: Extended gesture vocabulary
- [ ] Real-time audio parameter control

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Mapping system fully functional
- [ ] Latency tests confirming <10ms response
- [ ] Multi-gesture support validated
- [ ] Context awareness working correctly
- [ ] Integration tests with stem player
