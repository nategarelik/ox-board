# Task: Create stem caching and recall system

## Description
Implement intelligent caching system using IndexedDB to store separated stems locally, enabling instant recall of previously processed tracks and reducing processing overhead for repeat plays.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] StemCacheService class implemented
- [ ] IndexedDB storage for stem audio buffers
- [ ] Track fingerprinting for cache key generation
- [ ] Automatic cache management (LRU eviction)
- [ ] Cache integrity validation
- [ ] Progressive loading for large stem files
- [ ] Storage quota management (5GB limit)

## Technical Details
- Implement StemCacheService with methods:
  - cacheStems(trackId, stems): Store 4 stem buffers
  - loadCachedStems(trackId): Instant retrieval
  - validateCache(trackId): Integrity checking
  - manageCacheSize(): LRU eviction policy
- Use IndexedDB for efficient binary data storage
- Generate unique track fingerprints (audio hash + metadata)
- Implement compression for stem storage optimization
- Background cache warming for popular tracks

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Stem separation pipeline
- [ ] IndexedDB API and utilities
- [ ] Audio fingerprinting library

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Caching system fully implemented
- [ ] Performance tests for cache hit/miss scenarios
- [ ] Storage management tests
- [ ] Cache integrity validation
- [ ] Documentation for cache lifecycle
