# Task: Implement intelligent mix assistant

## Description
Build AI-powered mixing assistance that provides automatic beat synchronization, harmonic mixing suggestions, optimal transition points, and energy flow analysis to help DJs create seamless mixes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MixAssistant class with auto-sync capabilities
- [ ] Harmonic mixing suggestions based on key compatibility
- [ ] Automatic beat matching and phase alignment
- [ ] Optimal mix point detection using phrase analysis
- [ ] Energy flow analysis and visualization
- [ ] Next track suggestions based on current track
- [ ] Real-time mix quality feedback

## Technical Details
- Implement MixAssistant with methods:
  - autoSync(deckA, deckB): Phase-lock tracks with tempo matching
  - suggestNextTrack(currentTrack): Harmonic and energy-based recommendations
  - detectMixPoint(): Find optimal transition points using phrase structure
  - analyzeEnergyFlow(): Track energy progression for smooth mixing
  - harmonicMixing(): Key compatibility wheel and suggestions
- Use audio analysis data from Task 002 for intelligent decisions
- Implement Camelot wheel for harmonic mixing logic
- Real-time feedback on mix quality and timing

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: BPM and key detection
- [ ] Task 003: 4-stem player architecture
- [ ] Track library with metadata

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Auto-sync functionality working reliably
- [ ] Harmonic mixing suggestions accurate
- [ ] Mix point detection validated with DJ testing
- [ ] Energy flow analysis implemented
- [ ] Integration with existing mixer controls
