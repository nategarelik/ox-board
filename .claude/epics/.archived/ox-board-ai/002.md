# Task: Implement BPM and key detection with Essentia.js

## Description
Build comprehensive audio analysis capabilities using Essentia.js to detect BPM, musical key, phrase structure, and energy levels. This enables intelligent mixing features and automatic synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AudioAnalyzer class implemented with Essentia.js integration
- [ ] BPM detection with Â±0.01 BPM accuracy
- [ ] Musical key detection using chromagram analysis
- [ ] Phrase/structure segmentation for mix points
- [ ] RMS energy analysis over time
- [ ] Caching of analysis results
- [ ] Real-time processing capability for live audio

## Technical Details
- Implement AudioAnalyzer with methods:
  - detectBPM(audio): Onset detection and tempo estimation
  - detectKey(audio): Chromagram analysis and key classification
  - detectPhrases(audio): Structural segmentation for mix points
  - analyzeEnergy(audio): RMS energy envelope over time
- Use Essentia.js algorithms optimized for web performance
- Implement progressive analysis for long tracks
- Cache analysis results with track fingerprinting

## Dependencies
- [ ] Essentia.js library integration
- [ ] Audio buffer management utilities
- [ ] Caching system (IndexedDB)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all detection methods
- [ ] Unit tests for each analysis function
- [ ] Accuracy validation with reference tracks
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time use
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples
