# Task: Build 4-stem player architecture with Tone.js

## Description
Extend the existing Tone.js audio architecture to support 4 synchronized stem players per deck, enabling independent control of drums, bass, melody, and vocals with shared timing and effects processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] StemPlayer class extending existing audio engine
- [ ] 4 synchronized Tone.Players per deck (drums, bass, melody, vocals)
- [ ] Independent volume, EQ, and effects per stem
- [ ] Shared transport and timing synchronization
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing AudioMixer
- [ ] Master routing for combined output
- [ ] Individual stem muting/soloing controls

## Technical Details
- Extend existing Tone.js architecture with parallel stem players
- Implement StemPlayer class managing 4 synchronized Tone.Player instances
- Each stem has independent processing chain (volume, EQ, effects)
- Shared Tone.Transport for perfect synchronization
- Routing system: individual stems → stem effects → deck mixer → master
- Memory-efficient loading of stem audio buffers

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Stem separation pipeline complete
- [ ] Existing Tone.js integration
- [ ] AudioMixer class structure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] StemPlayer class implemented
- [ ] Integration tests with separated stems
- [ ] Performance tests with 4 concurrent stems
- [ ] Synchronization accuracy verification
- [ ] Documentation for stem routing architecture
