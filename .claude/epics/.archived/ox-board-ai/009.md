# Task: Implement per-stem effects processing

## Description
Add comprehensive effects processing capabilities for individual stems, allowing independent application of filters, reverb, delay, and other effects to each stem component with gesture-based control.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] StemEffectsProcessor class for per-stem effects chains
- [ ] Individual effects per stem (EQ, filter, reverb, delay, distortion)
- [ ] Gesture-controlled effect parameters
- [ ] Real-time parameter automation
- [ ] Effect preset system for quick recall
- [ ] Cross-stem effect routing options
- [ ] CPU-optimized effects processing

## Technical Details
- Extend StemPlayer with individual effects chains per stem
- Implement effects using Tone.js effects library:
  - 3-band EQ per stem
  - High/low-pass filters with resonance
  - Reverb with adjustable room size
  - Delay with tempo sync
  - Distortion/overdrive effects
- Connect gesture controls to effect parameters
- Implement effect automation and LFO modulation
- Add effect preset management system

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: 4-stem player architecture
- [ ] Task 006: Gesture-to-stem mapping
- [ ] Tone.js effects library

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All effects implemented and tested
- [ ] Gesture control integration working
- [ ] Preset system functional
- [ ] Performance optimization complete
- [ ] Audio quality validation passed
