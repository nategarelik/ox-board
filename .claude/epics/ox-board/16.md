# Task: Wire gesture controls to mixer/effects

## Description
Connect the existing gesture controls from the useGestures hook to the mixer controls and effects system. This will enable users to manipulate audio parameters through hand gestures captured by the camera.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Gesture events from useGestures hook are mapped to mixer parameters
- [ ] Volume, EQ, and filter controls respond to gesture input
- [ ] Effects (reverb, delay, distortion) can be triggered and controlled via gestures
- [ ] Gesture sensitivity and dead zones are properly configured
- [ ] Visual feedback shows which parameters are being controlled

## Technical Details
- Use existing useGestures hook output to drive mixer state changes
- Map gesture coordinates to audio parameter ranges (0-1, -1 to 1, etc.)
- Implement smoothing/interpolation for gesture-to-parameter mapping
- Add gesture calibration system for different user hand sizes
- Integrate with Tone.js audio effects and mixer components

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 14 (useGestures hook) must be completed first

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
