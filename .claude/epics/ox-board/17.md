# Task: Add BPM detection and beat sync

## Description
Implement BPM detection using Tone.js analyzers and add beat synchronization functionality to the DJ platform. This will enable tempo-based effects and automatic beat matching.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time BPM detection for audio streams
- [ ] Beat sync visualization with visual metronome
- [ ] Automatic tempo matching between decks
- [ ] Beat-synced effects (filters, delays, etc.)
- [ ] Manual BPM override capability
- [ ] BPM display in the mixer interface

## Technical Details
- Use Tone.js Analyser and FFT for beat detection algorithms
- Implement onset detection with peak picking
- Add tempo smoothing to avoid erratic BPM changes
- Create beat sync engine for cross-deck synchronization
- Build visual beat indicators and tempo displays
- Integrate with existing audio pipeline without disrupting playback

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 13 (Tone.js audio engine) must be completed first

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
