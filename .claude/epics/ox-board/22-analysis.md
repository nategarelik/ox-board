# Issue #22: Fix React lazy loading and AudioContext errors

## Work Stream Analysis

### Stream A: Fix Lazy Loading Errors (CRITICAL - BLOCKS RENDERING)
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Agent**: code-analyzer
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix first
**Files**:
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/components/**/*.tsx` (check all for lazy imports)
- Any files using `React.lazy()`

**Work**:
1. Search for all React.lazy() usage
2. Verify export syntax (must be default export)
3. Fix import/export mismatches
4. Test each lazy component loads

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

---

### Stream B: Fix AudioContext Initialization (BLOCKS AUDIO)
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Agent**: code-analyzer
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix
**Files**:
- `app/lib/audio/*.ts`
- `app/components/DJ/*.tsx`
- `app/stores/*Store*.ts`
- Any Tone.js initialization

**Work**:
1. Find all AudioContext/Tone.js initialization
2. Defer initialization until user gesture
3. Add initialization trigger (button or first click)
4. Update all audio components

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

---

### Stream C: Fix Hydration Mismatches
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Agent**: general-purpose
**Priority**: P1 - Important but not blocking
**Files**:
- `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`
- Check for dynamic styles

**Work**:
1. Identify hydration mismatch sources
2. Remove/fix dynamic styles
3. Ensure SSR/client consistency
4. Handle VS Code extension interference

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

## Execution Order

All three streams can run in PARALLEL as they touch different parts of the codebase:
- Stream A focuses on component exports/imports
- Stream B focuses on audio initialization
- Stream C focuses on SSR/hydration

## Coordination Points

- All streams should commit frequently
- Use descriptive commit messages
- No file conflicts expected between streams

## Risk Mitigation

1. Test each fix independently
2. Keep fixes minimal and focused
3. Don't refactor - just fix the specific issues
4. Verify in clean browser (no extensions)

## Success Metrics

- Zero console errors
- All components render
- Audio works after user interaction
- No hydration warnings
