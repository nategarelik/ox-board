# Task: Implement keyboard shortcuts

## Description
Implement keyboard shortcuts as fallback for all gesture controls to ensure accessibility and provide alternative input methods for users who prefer keyboard navigation or cannot use gestures effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All gesture controls have corresponding keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts are intuitive and follow common conventions
- [ ] Shortcuts work consistently across all components
- [ ] Visual indicators show available shortcuts to users
- [ ] No conflicts between shortcuts and existing browser/system shortcuts

## Technical Details
Create a centralized keyboard shortcut system that:
- Maps common keys to gesture actions (arrow keys for navigation, space/enter for selection)
- Implements proper event handling and prevention of default browser behavior
- Integrates with the existing gesture system from task 16
- Provides visual feedback for shortcut availability and usage

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 16 (Gesture recognition system) must be completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
