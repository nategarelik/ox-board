# Task: Performance optimization and testing

## Description
Comprehensive performance optimization and testing of all implemented features to ensure the ox-board application runs smoothly, efficiently, and reliably across different devices and usage scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components are performance-optimized
- [ ] Memory usage is within acceptable limits

- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage is achieved

## Technical Details
Perform end-to-end optimization including:
- React component optimization (memoization, lazy loading)
- Canvas rendering performance tuning
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Bundle size optimization
- Implement performance monitoring and metrics
- Create comprehensive test suite covering all features
- Load testing and stress testing
- Cross-browser and device testing
