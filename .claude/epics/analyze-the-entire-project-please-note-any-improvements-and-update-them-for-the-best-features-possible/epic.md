# Epic: Gesture-Controlled DJ Platform MVP

## Overview
Transform the existing ox-board codebase into a functional gesture-controlled DJ platform by leveraging already-installed dependencies (MediaPipe, Tone.js, Three.js) and focusing on core MVP features. The implementation prioritizes low-latency gesture recognition and audio mixing capabilities while maintaining simplicity and reusability.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technical Choices
- **Frontend-First Processing**: All gesture detection and audio processing happens client-side to minimize latency (<20ms target)
- **Component Architecture**: Modular React components with clear separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Use existing Zustand for global state (already installed)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with 5 basic gestures, architecture supports adding more

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **MediaPipe (already installed)**: Industry-standard hand tracking, runs efficiently in browser
- **Tone.js (already installed)**: Professional audio synthesis with low latency
- **Three.js (already installed)**: 3D visualizations, but defer to Phase 2
- **Next.js 15**: Existing setup provides excellent performance and deployment options

### Design Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: For gesture detection events
- **Command Pattern**: For mapping gestures to audio actions
- **Singleton**: For audio engine and camera manager
- **Factory**: For creating gesture recognizers

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

#### Core UI Components
1. **CameraFeed**: WebRTC camera display with MediaPipe overlay
2. **DJDeck**: Virtual turntable visualization (left/right decks)
3. **Mixer**: Crossfader, EQ, and volume controls
4. **GestureIndicator**: Real-time gesture feedback display
5. **Tutorial**: Interactive onboarding flow

#### State Management
- **Global State** (Zustand):
  - Audio engine state
  - Active gestures
  - Deck states (playing, BPM, position)
  - User preferences
- **Local State**:
  - UI animations
  - Temporary gesture positions

#### User Interaction Patterns
- Gesture zones: Define screen regions for different controls
- Visual feedback: Immediate UI response to detected gestures
- Fallback controls: Keyboard shortcuts for accessibility

### Backend Services

#### API Endpoints (Minimal for MVP)
1. `GET /api/tracks` - Retrieve demo tracks library
2. `POST /api/sessions/save` - Save mixing session
3. `GET /api/presets` - Load gesture presets

#### Data Models
```typescript
interface Track {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  bpm: number;
  key: string;
  waveform: Float32Array;
  audioUrl: string;
}

interface GestureMap {
  gestureName: string;
  action: AudioAction;
  sensitivity: number;
}

interface Session {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  tracks: Track[];
  actions: AudioAction[];
}
```

### Infrastructure

#### Deployment
- **Vercel**: Leverage existing Next.js integration
- **CDN**: Use Vercel's edge network for audio files
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics (already configured)

#### Monitoring
- Performance metrics via Web Vitals
- Error tracking with browser console
- Gesture accuracy tracking

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Week 1-2**: Core gesture detection and audio setup
2. **Week 3-4**: DJ interface and basic mixing
3. **Week 5-6**: Effects and advanced controls
4. **Week 7-8**: Polish, testing, and optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- **Gesture Accuracy**: Implement confidence thresholds and smoothing
- **Audio Latency**: Use Web Audio API directly when needed
- **Browser Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement with feature detection

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for gesture recognition logic
- Integration tests for audio engine
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance benchmarks for latency
