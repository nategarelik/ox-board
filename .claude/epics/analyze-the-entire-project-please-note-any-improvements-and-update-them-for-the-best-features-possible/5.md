# Task: DJ Deck Components

## Description
Build comprehensive DJ deck UI components including waveform displays, BPM counters, track information, and playback controls. Create reusable components that integrate with the audio engine and provide visual feedback for DJ operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dual deck layout with independent controls
- [ ] Real-time waveform visualization with zoom controls
- [ ] BPM counter with tap-to-beat functionality
- [ ] Track information display (title, artist, duration, time remaining)
- [ ] Play/pause, cue, loop controls
- [ ] Pitch/speed fader with numerical display
- [ ] Visual feedback for audio levels and clipping
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technical Details
- Implement using React/Vue components with Canvas API for waveforms
- Integrate with Web Audio API for real-time audio analysis
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth visual updates
- Implement touch-friendly controls for tablet/mobile use
- Consider performance optimization for waveform rendering
- Files affected: src/components/deck/, src/styles/deck.css
