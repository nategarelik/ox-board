# Task: Testing Infrastructure - Unit/integration tests, gesture accuracy tests

## Description
Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure for both gesture recognition accuracy and audio engine performance. This includes unit tests for individual components, integration tests for system interactions, and specialized tests for gesture recognition precision and audio latency validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Jest testing framework configured with TypeScript support
- [ ] Unit tests for gesture detection with >95% code coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for audio engine components with >90% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for gesture-to-audio control pipeline
- [ ] Gesture accuracy tests achieving >90% recognition rate
- [ ] Audio latency tests confirming <20ms response time
- [ ] Performance tests for 60 FPS gesture tracking maintenance
- [ ] Mock MediaPipe and Web Audio API for consistent testing
- [ ] Automated test runner in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Visual regression tests for UI components

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Jest + React Testing Library + custom test utilities
- **Key files to create**:
  - `/__tests__/lib/gesture/detector.test.ts` - MediaPipe wrapper tests
  - `/__tests__/lib/audio/engine.test.ts` - Audio engine tests
  - `/__tests__/components/Camera/CameraFeed.test.tsx` - Camera component tests
  - `/__tests__/integration/gesture-audio.test.ts` - End-to-end pipeline tests
  - `/__tests__/performance/fps.test.ts` - Performance benchmarks
  - `/__tests__/utils/mocks.ts` - Mock MediaPipe and Web Audio
  - `/jest.config.js` - Jest configuration
- **Test categories**: Unit (components), Integration (workflows), Performance (benchmarks)
- **Mocking strategy**: Mock external APIs while testing business logic thoroughly
- **Accuracy testing**: Simulated hand positions with known expected outputs

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Gesture Detection Setup completed
- [ ] Task 003: Audio Engine Core completed
- [ ] Jest and testing dependencies installed
- [ ] Test environment configuration
- [ ] Sample test data for gesture patterns

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Jest configured with proper TypeScript and React support
- [ ] Complete test suite for gesture detection system
- [ ] Complete test suite for audio engine functionality
- [ ] Integration tests covering gesture-to-audio mapping
- [ ] Performance tests validating frame rate and latency targets
- [ ] All tests passing with required coverage thresholds
- [ ] Automated testing in GitHub Actions or similar CI
- [ ] Test documentation and examples for new developers
- [ ] Mock services that don't require actual hardware
- [ ] Benchmark tests establishing performance baselines
