# Task: Performance Optimization

## Description
Optimize the application's performance by reducing latency, improving frame rates, and implementing efficient resource management. Focus on critical path optimization, caching strategies, and smooth user interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application loads within 2 seconds on average hardware
- [ ] UI interactions maintain 60fps during animations and transitions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended use
- [ ] Network requests are optimized with proper caching
- [ ] Bundle size is minimized through code splitting and tree shaking
- [ ] Performance metrics are implemented and monitored

## Technical Details
- Implement React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
- Add virtualization for large lists/grids
- Optimize image loading with lazy loading and WebP format
- Implement service worker for offline caching
- Add performance monitoring with Web Vitals
- Optimize bundle splitting and chunk loading
- Database query optimization and connection pooling
- Implement CDN for static assets

## Dependencies
- [ ] Core game engine (Task 002)
- [ ] Database layer (Task 003)
- [ ] UI components (Task 005)
- [ ] Authentication system (Task 006)
- [ ] Real-time features (Task 007)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
