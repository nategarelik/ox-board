# Task: Mixer Interface

## Description
Create a professional mixer interface with crossfader, EQ controls, volume faders, and effect controls. Design an intuitive layout that mimics physical DJ mixers while leveraging digital advantages like visual feedback and precise control.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Crossfader with smooth interpolation and curve adjustment
- [ ] 3-band EQ (high, mid, low) for each deck with kill switches
- [ ] Channel volume faders with pre-fade listening
- [ ] Master volume control with limiter
- [ ] Gain controls with level meters
- [ ] Effect send/return controls
- [ ] Cue/monitor controls for headphone mixing
- [ ] Visual level meters with peak indicators

## Technical Details
- Implement custom slider components with touch/mouse support
- Use Web Audio API GainNode and BiquadFilterNode for EQ
- Implement smooth parameter interpolation to avoid audio clicks
- Create visual feedback system for all controls
- Consider accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Files affected: src/components/mixer/, src/audio/mixer.js, src/styles/mixer.css

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Audio Engine Core (required for audio processing)
- [ ] Web Audio API filter and gain nodes
- [ ] Touch event handling for mobile devices

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All mixer controls implemented and functional
- [ ] Audio processing working without artifacts
- [ ] Visual feedback responsive and accurate
- [ ] Tests covering all mixer functionality
- [ ] Performance optimized for real-time audio
- [ ] Documentation for mixer API and usage
