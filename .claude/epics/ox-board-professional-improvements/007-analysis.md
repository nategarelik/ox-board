# Task 007 Analysis: Setup Development Standards

## Overview
Implement professional development standards including CI/CD, testing, and commit standards.

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream 1: CI/CD Pipeline (1 hour)
**Agent Type**: parallel-worker
**Scope**: GitHub Actions workflow setup

**Files to Create**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Auto-deploy workflow
- `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration (if needed)

**Requirements**:
- Lint, test, and build stages
- Run on push to main and PR events
- Auto-deploy to Vercel on main branch
- Cache dependencies for faster builds
- Matrix testing for Node versions

**No Dependencies** - Can start immediately

### Stream 2: Commit Standards (1 hour)
**Agent Type**: parallel-worker
**Scope**: Husky and commitlint setup

**Files to Create**:
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook
- `.husky/commit-msg` - Commit message validation
- `.commitlintrc.js` - Commitlint configuration

**Files to Modify**:
- `package.json` - Add husky scripts and dependencies

**Requirements**:
- Install: husky, commitlint, @commitlint/config-conventional, lint-staged
- Conventional commits format enforcement
- Pre-commit: run lint and tests on staged files
- Commit-msg: validate commit format
- Configure lint-staged for TypeScript/JavaScript

**No Dependencies** - Can start immediately

### Stream 3: Critical Path Testing (1 hour)
**Agent Type**: parallel-worker
**Scope**: Test implementation for critical flows

**Files to Create**:
- `app/__tests__/page.test.tsx` - Main page test
- `app/__tests__/integration/dj-mode.test.tsx` - DJ mode flow
- `app/__tests__/integration/audio-upload.test.tsx` - Audio processing
- `app/__tests__/integration/gesture-control.test.tsx` - Gesture flow

**Requirements**:
- Test critical user flows:
  1. Loading main DJ interface
  2. Starting/stopping DJ mode
  3. Audio file upload and processing
  4. Gesture control initialization
  5. View mode switching
- Use existing Jest/React Testing Library setup
- Mock external dependencies (Tone.js, MediaPipe)
- Achieve >70% coverage on critical paths

**No Dependencies** - Can start immediately

## Coordination Points

1. **Package Installation** (First 15 mins):
   - Stream 2 installs husky/commitlint packages
   - Coordinate package.json updates to avoid conflicts
   - Share dependency versions

2. **Integration Points**:
   - CI pipeline runs tests from Stream 3
   - Pre-commit hooks run tests from Stream 3
   - Deploy workflow needs build to pass

3. **Documentation**:
   - Each stream updates README with their setup
   - Create CONTRIBUTING.md with standards
   - Document commit message format

## Success Criteria
- ✅ CI pipeline passes on all commits
- ✅ Commits follow conventional format
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks prevent bad code
- ✅ Critical paths have test coverage
- ✅ Auto-deploy works on main branch

## Conflict Avoidance
- Stream 1 owns: `.github/` directory
- Stream 2 owns: `.husky/`, `.commitlintrc.js`
- Stream 3 owns: `app/__tests__/` directory
- Coordinate package.json updates via comments

## Dependencies to Install
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "husky": "^8.0.0",
    "@commitlint/cli": "^18.0.0",
    "@commitlint/config-conventional": "^18.0.0",
    "lint-staged": "^15.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Estimated Completion
Total: 3 hours (1 hour per stream in parallel)
