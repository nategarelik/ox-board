# Task: Fix Critical Browser Errors

## Description
Resolve production-breaking errors including AudioContext browser policy violations, React lazy loading crashes, and SSR hydration mismatches. This task unblocks basic functionality and addresses GitHub Issue #22.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AudioContext initialized only after user interaction (button click)
- [ ] React lazy loading works without crashes
- [ ] SSR hydration errors resolved
- [ ] Error boundaries properly implemented
- [ ] Zero console errors on page load

## Technical Details
- **AudioContext Fix**: Create deferred initialization with "Start DJ Session" button
- **Lazy Loading Fix**: Add proper Suspense boundaries with fallback components
- **SSR Fix**: Move dynamic styles to useEffect, add suppressHydrationWarning where needed
- **Files Affected**: app/page.tsx, app/lib/audio/AudioMixer.ts, app/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx

## Dependencies
- [ ] No external dependencies
- [ ] Can begin immediately

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: false (blocks other work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with fixes
- [ ] Manual testing in Chrome/Firefox/Edge
- [ ] No console errors in any browser
- [ ] Audio starts only after user interaction
- [ ] Page loads without hydration warnings
