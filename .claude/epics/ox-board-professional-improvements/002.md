# Task: Refactor Page Architecture

## Description
Extract monolithic page.tsx into 5 focused, reusable components. This addresses GitHub Issues #5, #6, and #14 by creating proper separation of concerns and maintainable architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] page.tsx reduced to < 100 lines
- [ ] 5 new components created and integrated
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Props and interfaces properly typed
- [ ] Components follow React best practices

## Technical Details
- **Components to Create**:
  - DJInterface.tsx - Main container orchestrating all features
  - AudioMixer.tsx - Mixing, effects, and deck controls
  - GestureControl.tsx - Gesture detection and mapping
  - TrackManager.tsx - Track loading and playlist
  - TutorialOverlay.tsx - Onboarding and help
- **Files Affected**: app/page.tsx, app/components/dj/*, app/types/dj.ts
- **Pattern**: Use composition over inheritance, keep components focused

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 must be complete (need working base)
- [ ] No external dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: false (major refactor)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 5 components created and working
- [ ] page.tsx refactored to use components
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [ ] Components properly exported
- [ ] Application works as before
