# Task: Add BPM and Effects

## Description
Implement BPM detection, beat synchronization, and audio effects processing. Addresses GitHub Issue #17.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BPM detection accurate to Â±2 BPM
- [ ] Beat sync between decks functional
- [ ] Effects (reverb, delay, filter) working
- [ ] Real-time effect parameter control
- [ ] Visual BPM display for each deck

## Technical Details
- **BPM Detection**:
  - Use Tone.js analyser nodes
  - Implement peak detection algorithm
  - Running average for stability
- **Beat Sync**:
  - Calculate tempo ratio between decks
  - Gradual pitch adjustment
  - Visual beat grid alignment
- **Effects Chain**:
  - Reverb, delay, filter, bitcrusher
  - Wet/dry mix control
  - Bypass switches
- **Files Affected**: app/lib/audio/BPMDetector.ts, app/lib/audio/EffectsProcessor.ts

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 complete (audio system)
- [ ] Tone.js effects (already available)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-5
- Parallel: true (can work alongside Task 005)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] BPM detection working accurately
- [ ] Beat sync functional
- [ ] All effects processable in real-time
- [ ] No audio artifacts
- [ ] Visual feedback for BPM/sync
