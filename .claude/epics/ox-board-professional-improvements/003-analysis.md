# Task 003 Analysis: Complete Audio System

## Overview
Implement complete audio system with service layer, dual-deck support, and proper mixing capabilities.

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream 1: Core AudioService (3 hours)
**Agent Type**: parallel-worker
**Scope**: Foundation audio service implementation

**Files to Create**:
- `app/services/AudioService.ts` - Main service
- `app/services/types/audio.ts` - Type definitions

**Requirements**:
- Singleton service managing Tone.js context
- Deferred initialization (user gesture required)
- Error boundaries for audio failures
- State management for audio context
- Methods: initialize(), getContext(), dispose(), isReady()

**No Dependencies** - Can start immediately

### Stream 2: Dual-Deck System (3 hours)
**Agent Type**: parallel-worker
**Scope**: Deck management and playback

**Files to Create**:
- `app/services/DeckManager.ts` - Deck service
- `app/lib/audio/deck.ts` - Deck implementation

**Requirements**:
- Two independent deck instances
- Load/play/pause/cue functionality
- BPM detection placeholder
- Track position management
- Waveform data generation

**Dependency**: Only needs AudioService type definitions (not implementation)

### Stream 3: Mixing & Crossfading (2 hours)
**Agent Type**: parallel-worker
**Scope**: Audio mixing capabilities

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/lib/audio/enhancedMixer.ts` - Add crossfading
- Create: `app/lib/audio/crossfader.ts` - Crossfader implementation

**Requirements**:
- Smooth crossfade between decks
- EQ per channel (3-band minimum)
- Gain/volume control per deck
- Master output control
- Filter effects integration

**Dependency**: Can work with interface definitions only

## Coordination Points

1. **Interface Agreement** (First 30 mins):
   - All streams agree on AudioService interface
   - Define shared types in `app/services/types/audio.ts`
   - Document method signatures

2. **Integration Points**:
   - DeckManager uses AudioService.getContext()
   - Mixer connects to deck outputs
   - Components import from services, not lib directly

3. **Testing Approach**:
   - Each stream creates unit tests
   - Integration test after merge
   - Manual testing with sample tracks

## Success Criteria
- ✅ AudioService manages all Tone.js interactions
- ✅ Two decks can play simultaneously
- ✅ Crossfader works smoothly
- ✅ No audio initialization errors
- ✅ Components use service layer

## Conflict Avoidance
- Stream 1 owns: `/services/AudioService.ts`, `/services/types/`
- Stream 2 owns: `/services/DeckManager.ts`, `/lib/audio/deck.ts`
- Stream 3 owns: `/lib/audio/enhancedMixer.ts`, `/lib/audio/crossfader.ts`
- No overlapping file modifications
