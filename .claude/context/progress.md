- 🎯 Dual deck players with independent controls
- 🎯 Gesture-controlled crossfading and volume
- 🎯 3-band EQ per channel
- 🎯 Effects processing (reverb, delay, filters)
- 🎯 BPM detection and beat matching
- 🎯 Tutorial system for onboarding
- 🎯 < 50ms gesture latency
- 🎯 Keyboard shortcuts as backup

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Recording capabilities
- Social features and user accounts
- Mobile browser support
- MIDI controller support
- Advanced 3D visualizations
- Collaborative mixing sessions

## Dependencies Status

### Actively Used
- `next@15.0.3` - Framework
- `react@19.0.0` - UI library
- `@mediapipe/hands@0.4.0` - Hand tracking
- `@mediapipe/camera_utils@0.3.0` - Camera handling
- `tone@15.0.4` - Audio synthesis and mixing
- `zustand@5.0.1` - State management
- `tailwindcss@3.4.16` - Styling
- `typescript@5.7.2` - Type safety

### Installed but Not Yet Integrated
- `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei` - 3D visualizations planned
- `socket.io`, `socket.io-client` - Real-time collaboration planned
- `@vercel/kv` - Track library storage planned
- `framer-motion` - Advanced animations planned

## Current Sprint (Same-Day MVP Implementation)

### Critical Path (Sequential Tasks)
1. **🔄 Task #13**: AudioMixer with Tone.Player integration
   - Extend existing AudioMixer class
   - Add Tone.Player instances to channels
   - Wire up playback controls
   - **Status**: Ready to start (foundation task)

2. **⏳ Task #14**: Unified DJ interface component
   - Create single DJ component with decks + mixer
   - Replace placeholder mixer UI
   - Add track loading interface
   - **Depends on**: #13

3. **⏳ Task #15**: Track loading (local + streaming)
   - YouTube URL to audio stream
   - SoundCloud URL to audio stream
   - Local file upload fallback
   - **Depends on**: #13, #14

4. **⏳ Task #16**: Wire gesture controls
   - Map gestures to mixer controls
   - Crossfader, volume, EQ via gestures
   - Effect triggers
   - **Depends on**: #13, #14, #15

5. **⏳ Task #20**: Testing and optimization
   - Performance tuning
   - Latency optimization
   - Bug fixes
   - **Depends on**: All previous tasks

### Parallel Tasks (Can work simultaneously)
- **⏳ Task #17**: BPM detection and beat sync
- **⏳ Task #18**: Tutorial overlay system
- **⏳ Task #19**: Keyboard shortcuts

### Timeline
- **Total Estimated Effort**: 9.5 hours
- **Target Completion**: Same day
- **Current Phase**: Ready to begin implementation

## Resolved Issues

### Previously Critical (Now Fixed)
- ✅ Duplicate Kalman filter implementations
- ✅ Memory leak in MediaPipe cleanup
- ✅ CORS headers blocking MediaPipe CDN
- ✅ Missing AudioMixer implementation
- ✅ No state management system
- ✅ Components not integrated

### Build Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ TypeScript type errors in page.tsx
- ✅ ESLint unescaped entities warnings
- ✅ React Hook dependency warnings

## Development Environment

- **Node.js**: v18+ required
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:3000
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (successful)
- **Production Build**: 168 KB First Load JS
- **Test Command**: Tests pending implementation

## Recent Decisions

1. **Zustand for State**: Chosen for simplicity and DevTools support
2. **Error Boundaries**: Three-tier system (page/section/component)
3. **Gesture Mapping**: Index finger for volume, wrist for crossfader
4. **Kalman Filtering**: Implemented for smooth gesture tracking
5. **Dynamic Imports**: Used for code splitting (CameraFeed, Mixer)

## Metrics

### Foundation Phase (Completed)
- **Files Created**: 25+
- **Components Built**: 15+ (CameraFeed, Mixer, ErrorBoundary, etc.)
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500 infrastructure lines
- **Foundation Features**: 12/12 complete
- **Bundle Size**: 168 KB First Load JS
- **Build Time**: ~15 seconds
- **Performance**: 60 FPS gesture processing

### MVP Phase (Current)
- **Epic**: #12 ox-board MVP (0% complete)
- **Tasks Defined**: 8 implementation tasks
- **GitHub Integration**: Complete
- **PRD Coverage**: 100% requirements documented
- **Target Features**: 10 core DJ functions
- **Performance Goals**: <20ms audio, <50ms gesture latency

## Implementation Roadmap

### Current Session Goals (Priority Order)
1. **Start Task #13**: AudioMixer + Tone.Player integration
2. **Continue with Task #14**: DJ interface component
3. **Progress through critical path**: Tasks #15, #16, #20
4. **Parallel implementation**: Tasks #17, #18, #19 as time allows

### Success Criteria for Today
- [ ] Load and play tracks from URLs
- [ ] Mix between two tracks using gestures
- [ ] Apply at least 3 effects
- [ ] < 50ms gesture latency maintained
- [ ] Basic tutorial system functional

### Tomorrow's Goals (Phase 2)
- Polish UI and UX
