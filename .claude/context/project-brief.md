# Project Brief

## Executive Summary

OX Board is transforming from a basic Next.js application into a revolutionary gesture-controlled DJ platform that democratizes music mixing by eliminating the need for expensive physical equipment. Using just a webcam and hand gestures, users can perform professional-quality DJ sets directly in their browser.

## Project Scope

### What We're Building
A web-based DJ application that:
- Detects hand gestures via webcam using MediaPipe
- Translates gestures into DJ controls (play, mix, effects)
- Provides dual-deck audio mixing with Tone.js
- Offers visual feedback and 3D visualizations
- Enables collaborative DJ sessions
- Works entirely in the browser without plugins

### What We're NOT Building
- Native mobile applications
- Physical hardware devices
- Music production/DAW features
- Professional streaming integration
- Video mixing capabilities
- Spotify/Apple Music integration (licensing)

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Accessibility**: Enable anyone to DJ without equipment
2. **Innovation**: First mainstream gesture-controlled DJ platform
3. **Education**: Lower barrier to learning DJ skills
4. **Social**: Create collaborative music experiences

### Specific Objectives
- Achieve <50ms gesture recognition latency
- Support 95%+ gesture accuracy in normal lighting
- Enable <20ms audio processing latency
- Handle 2-deck mixing at 48kHz quality
- Support 4+ simultaneous users in collaborative mode
- Load and be interactive within 3 seconds

### Success Criteria
- 50,000 registered users within 6 months
- 40% user retention after 30 days
- 20+ minute average session length
- 90+ Lighthouse performance score
- Zero equipment required for full functionality

## Key Stakeholders

### Direct Stakeholders
1. **Development Team**: 2-3 engineers building the platform
2. **Target Users**: Theta Chi fraternity members at UW-Madison
3. **Product Owner**: Project creator and vision holder

### Indirect Stakeholders
1. **Future Users**: Aspiring DJs, music enthusiasts, event hosts
2. **Open Source Community**: Contributors and users
3. **Technology Partners**: MediaPipe, Tone.js communities

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari browsers
- Requires webcam access permission
- Needs minimum 4GB RAM on user device
- Limited by browser audio processing capabilities
- WebRTC limitations for peer-to-peer features

### Resource Constraints
- 2-3 developers available
- 8-10 week timeline to MVP
- $50,000 initial budget
- No dedicated designer initially
- Limited QA resources

### Business Constraints
- Cannot use copyrighted music (licensing)
- Must respect music industry regulations
- No monetization in initial release
- Open source considerations

## Timeline & Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- ✅ Project setup and planning
- ⏳ Gesture detection system
- ⏳ Audio engine initialization
- ⏳ Basic UI components

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] DJ deck interface
- [ ] Mixer controls
- [ ] Gesture mapping system
- [ ] Tutorial implementation

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Effects library
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing infrastructure
- [ ] Accessibility features

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Deployment pipeline
- [ ] Bug fixes
- [ ] Launch preparation

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Gesture Recognition Accuracy**
   - Risk: Poor detection ruins user experience
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, fallback controls

2. **Audio Latency**
   - Risk: Delays make real-time mixing impossible
   - Mitigation: Optimize processing, use Web Audio API directly

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Risk: Limited browser support reduces reach
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, clear requirements

### Moderate Risks
1. **User Adoption**: Novel interface may confuse users
2. **Performance**: Low-end devices may struggle
3. **Lighting Conditions**: Dark environments affect detection

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- Next.js 15.0.3 (React framework)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Zustand (state management)

### Core Libraries
- MediaPipe (hand tracking)
- Tone.js (audio synthesis)
- Three.js (3D visualizations)
- Socket.io (real-time collaboration)

### Infrastructure
- Vercel (hosting and deployment)
- Vercel KV (Redis for sessions)
- GitHub (version control)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Unique Value Proposition

### For Users
- **Zero Cost**: No equipment purchase required
- **Instant Access**: Start DJing in seconds
- **Natural Interface**: Intuitive gesture controls
- **Social Features**: DJ with friends remotely
- **Learning Tool**: Built-in tutorials and progression

### Market Differentiation
- **First to Market**: No direct competitors exist
- **Patent Potential**: Novel gesture mapping system
- **Viral Potential**: Visually impressive for social media
- **Accessibility**: Opens DJing to new demographics
