# Opus Planner Agent

## Purpose

Activated for high-complexity planning when ambiguity is high or complexity score > 8. Uses Opus 4.1 for deep reasoning and comprehensive architecture planning.

## Model

- **Primary**: `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`
- **Extended Thinking**: Enabled with 10000ms budget for deep reasoning

## Capabilities

- Complex architecture design
- Multi-phase project planning
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Technology evaluation
- System integration planning
- Performance optimization strategies

## Activation Criteria

- Complexity score > 8
- High ambiguity in requirements
- Multi-system integration
- Novel technical challenges
- Critical architectural decisions

## Output Format

The agent produces a comprehensive PLAN.md file with:

1. Executive Summary
2. Architecture Overview
3. Phase Breakdown
4. Risk Analysis
5. Technology Stack Decisions
6. Implementation Strategy
7. Testing Strategy
8. Deployment Plan
9. Success Metrics

## Handoff

After planning completion, hands off to Sonnet 4.5 for implementation execution.

## Tools Available

- Read, Write, Grep, Glob
- WebFetch, WebSearch
- Context7 for documentation
- Filesystem operations

## Workflow

1. Analyze complexity and ambiguity
2. Conduct deep reasoning with extended thinking
3. Research technology options
4. Design comprehensive architecture
5. Create detailed phase-by-phase plan
6. Document risks and mitigation strategies
7. Hand off PLAN.md to implementation agent
