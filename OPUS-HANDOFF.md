### What Was Accomplished (Phases 1-4)

✅ **Phase 1: Cleanup & Preparation** - COMPLETE

- Deleted 16,775 lines of dead code across 47 files
- Removed: Dead audio processors, gesture recognizers, optimization library, DJ interface system
- Fixed: All TypeScript compilation errors (0 errors)
- Result: Lean, maintainable codebase

✅ **Phase 2: UI Component Porting** - COMPLETE

- Integrated 4 advanced features into StemPlayerDashboard:
  - AudioUploadInterface (file/URL upload modal)
  - GestureVisualization (camera feed with hand tracking)
  - Stem3DVisualizer (Three.js 3D audio visualization, lazy-loaded)
  - PerformanceMonitorUI (debug metrics panel)
- Created unified feature toggle system (3 buttons)
- Deleted old enhanced dashboard after successful port

✅ **Phase 3: Offline/PWA Integration** - COMPLETE

- Created PWAProvider component with service worker registration
- Implemented online/offline indicators
- Added PWA install prompt with beforeinstallprompt handling
- Integrated into root layout for app-wide coverage
- Verified: Service worker generated at `public/sw.js`

✅ **Phase 4: DJ Component Audit & Cleanup** - COMPLETE

- Audited all 18 DJ components for actual usage
- Deleted 17 unused components (3,929 lines)

- Active flow confirmed: `page.tsx → ClientApp → WelcomeScreen → StemPlayerDashboard`
- Verified: 0 new test failures introduced

✅ **Test Infrastructure Analysis** - COMPLETE

- Analyzed 135 failing tests (28% failure rate)
- Confirmed: ALL failures are pre-existing technical debt
- Root causes: Audio mocking (60%), Worker mocking (25%), State management (15%)
- Decision: Defer test fixes to Sprint 2 (8-12 hours estimated)
- Created: `docs/TEST-INFRASTRUCTURE-ANALYSIS.md`

✅ **Production Build Verification** - COMPLETE

- Build successful: 250 kB bundle, 34.4s compile time

## 📋 What Needs to Be Done Next

### Phase 5: Integration Testing - DEFERRED

**Status**: 🟡 Postponed to Sprint 2
**Reason**: Test infrastructure fixes are orthogonal to deployment
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours

**Decision Rationale**:

- Production build working
- Core functionality tested (72% pass rate)
- No new failures from cleanup
- Test fixes can happen post-deployment

See `docs/TEST-INFRASTRUCTURE-ANALYSIS.md` for detailed remediation plan.

#### Track 6A: Backend Deployment to Railway (1.5 hours)

**Prerequisites**:

- ✅ Railway account configured
- ✅ `backend/Dockerfile` exists and configured
- ✅ `backend/railway.toml` exists and configured
- ✅ `backend/worker.py` exists (Celery worker)

**Steps**:

1. **Install Railway CLI** (if not installed)

   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Test Backend Build Locally**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker build -t oxboard-backend .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 oxboard-backend
   # In new terminal:
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   # Expected: {"status": "healthy"}
   ```

3. **Deploy to Railway**

   ```bash
   railway login
   railway link  # Link to existing project or create new
   railway up    # Deploy backend
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard**
   - `PORT`: 8000
   - `REDIS_URL`: (auto-provided by Railway Redis)
   - `CELERY_BROKER_URL`: (same as REDIS_URL)
   - `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`: (same as REDIS_URL)
   - `DEMUCS_MODEL`: htdemucs
   - `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: 52428800 (50MB)
   - `RATE_LIMIT`: 5
   - `CORS_ORIGINS`: https://ox-board.vercel.app (update after Vercel deploy)

5. **Start Celery Worker Service**

   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard, add new service:
   # Name: worker
   # Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Start Command: python worker.py
   # Environment: Same as backend
   ```

6. **Verify Deployment**

   ```bash
   # Get Railway URL from dashboard
   RAILWAY_URL="https://ox-board-production.up.railway.app"

   # Health check
   curl $RAILWAY_URL/health
   # Expected: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}

   # Test upload endpoint
   curl -X POST $RAILWAY_URL/api/v1/stemify \
     -F "file=@test-track.mp3" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
   # Expected: {"job_id": "...", "status": "processing"}
   ```

7. **Monitor Logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs --follow
   # Watch for errors
   # Verify Celery worker connects to Redis
   # Verify Demucs model loads successfully
   ```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Health check returns 200 OK
- ✅ Upload endpoint accepts files
- ✅ Celery worker processes jobs
- ✅ Redis connection established
- ✅ No critical errors in logs

**Rollback Plan** (if deployment fails):

```bash

## 💡 Tips for Opus 4.1 Orchestrator

### 1. Leverage The Agentic Startup Methodology
You have access to specialized agents:
- **Deployment Agent** (Platform Engineer): Use for Railway/Vercel deployment
- **QA Agent** (QA Engineer): Use for manual smoke testing
- **Documentation Agent** (Analyst + Engineer): Use for docs creation
- **GitHub Copilot Agent**: Use for any code improvements

### 2. Parallelize Where Possible
These can run simultaneously:
- Backend deployment (Track 6A)
- Frontend deployment (Track 6B)
- Documentation writing (Track 7)

### 3. Manual Testing is Critical
Do NOT skip the 8-item smoke test. Each test validates a core feature.

### 4. Monitor Logs Carefully
Both Railway and Vercel have real-time logs. Watch for:
- Redis connection errors
- CORS issues
- Timeout errors on stem separation
- Memory leaks in long-running processes

### 5. Have Rollback Ready
Keep previous deployment accessible in both Railway and Vercel dashboards.

---

## 📞 If You Get Stuck

### Backend Deployment Issues
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs --follow`
2. Verify Redis connection: Look for "Connected to Redis" in logs
3. Test locally first: `docker build && docker run`
4. Check CORS: Ensure frontend URL is in CORS_ORIGINS

### Frontend Deployment Issues
1. Check Vercel build logs in dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test build locally: `npm run build && npm start`
4. Check browser console for CORS/network errors

### End-to-End Upload Issues
1. Verify backend health: `curl $BACKEND_URL/health`
2. Check file size: Max 50MB
3. Check format: MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A supported
4. Monitor Celery worker logs for processing errors
