### Production Build

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 34.4s
Route (app)                     Size  First Load JS
┌ ○ /                        68.5 kB         250 kB
```

- Bundle: 250 kB (within target)
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- ESLint: 3 warnings (non-blocking)
- Service Worker: Generated and working

### Configuration

- Backend: Railway-ready (Dockerfile, railway.toml, worker.py)
- Frontend: Vercel-ready (.env.production, build tested)
- PWA: Manifest + Service Worker configured

## 📋 Next Session Tasks (for Opus 4.1)

### Phase 6: Production Deployment (2-3 hours)

#### Pre-Flight (30 min)

**Must complete 8-item manual smoke test:**

1. Gesture recognition works
2. Audio upload & playback works
3. Stem controls responsive
4. PWA install works
5. Offline mode works
6. 3D visualizer loads
7. Gesture visualization shows
8. Performance monitor displays metrics

#### Track 6A: Backend to Railway (1.5 hours)

```bash
# Test locally
cd backend
docker build -t oxboard-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 oxboard-backend

# Deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up

# Configure environment variables in Railway dashboard
# Start Celery worker service
# Verify health check: curl $RAILWAY_URL/health
```

#### Track 6B: Frontend to Vercel (1.5 hours)

```bash
# Test locally
npm run build
npm start

# Deploy
vercel login
vercel --prod

# Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Update CORS in Railway backend
# Test deployed URL
```

### Phase 7: Documentation (1-2 hours)

1. Update README.md (features, quick start, tech stack)
2. Create USER-GUIDE.md (getting started, gestures, troubleshooting)
3. Create DEPLOYMENT.md (Railway + Vercel steps)
4. Create API.md (endpoint reference)
5. Final cleanup (console.logs, version tag v1.0.0)

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Kept best features from both implementations
2. **Test Strategy**: Deploy now, fix test infrastructure in Sprint 2
3. **Active Flow**: Single unified UI path (no multiple competing implementations)
4. **PWA Integration**: Full offline support with service worker
