# OX Gesture Stem Player Specification

## Problem Statement

Music lovers want to interact with songs more deeply - separating stems (vocals, drums, bass, melody), adjusting them individually, and applying effects using natural hand movements - without needing professional DJ skills or complex interfaces.

Traditional music players are limited to basic playback controls, while professional DJ software is overwhelming for casual users. There's a gap for an accessible yet powerful tool that makes advanced music manipulation feel natural and intuitive.

- **Intuitive Gesture Control**: Natural hand movements (pinch, roll, spread) control audio parameters
- **Professional Audio Quality**: Real-time stem separation with EQ, compression, and effects
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time waveform display and gesture recognition visualization
- **Accessibility First**: Full keyboard and screen reader support for all functions
- **Privacy Focused**: All vision processing happens on-device, camera never leaves client

## Target Users

- **Music Enthusiasts**: Want to explore songs more deeply without complexity
- **Content Creators**: Need to extract stems for remixing and production
- **Accessibility Users**: Benefit from keyboard and screen reader support
- **Casual Performers**: Want expressive control without professional DJ workflow

## Core User Journey
