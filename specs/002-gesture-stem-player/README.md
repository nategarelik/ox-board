## 🚀 Quick Start

### Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation & Stability** (Week 1-2): Dependencies, AudioWorklets, gesture system
2. **Core Features** (Week 3-4): Gesture language, audio processing, performance monitoring
3. **Polish & Optimization** (Week 5-6): Cross-browser testing, memory optimization, visual features

### Enhanced Web Architecture Dependencies

```json
{
  "next": "^15.5.4", // PWA-optimized app shell
  "tone": "^15.1.22", // Enhanced audio scheduling
  "wavesurfer.js": "^7.10.3", // Modern waveform display
  "@mediapipe/tasks-vision": "0.10.21", // Stable gesture recognition
  "meyda": "^5.4.0", // MIT-licensed audio analysis
  "standardized-audio-context": "^25.3.35", // Cross-browser audio
  "next-pwa": "^5.6.0", // PWA capabilities
  "web-vitals": "^3.5.0" // Performance monitoring
}
```

## 🎯 Performance Targets

### Latency Requirements

- **Gesture Processing**: ≤15-30ms per frame
- **Audio Scheduling**: Sample-accurate with AudioParams
- **Total E2E**: ≤50ms gesture-to-sound

### Quality Standards

- **Memory Usage**: <200MB working set
- **CPU Usage**: <40% during active operation
- **Frame Rate**: 60fps gesture recognition and UI
- **Error Rate**: <1% crash rate in production

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
