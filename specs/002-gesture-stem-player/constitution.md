# Constitution: OX Gesture Stem Player

## Mission

Transform OX Board into an impressive yet accessible gesture-controlled stem player that combines professional audio quality with intuitive hand controls - making advanced music manipulation feel natural for everyday users.

## Quality Standards

### Performance Requirements

- **Latency**: â‰¤50ms gesture-to-sound (achievable: 21-43ms with AudioWorklets)
- **Stability**: 99%+ uptime, graceful error recovery, no memory leaks
- **Responsiveness**: 60fps gesture recognition and UI updates
- **Resource Usage**: <200MB RAM, <40% CPU during active playback
- **Cross-Platform**: Progressive Web App with native-like experience

### User Experience Standards

- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard parity, screen reader support, intuitive gestures
- **Privacy**: On-device vision processing, camera never leaves client
- **Learnability**: 90% of users can perform basic stem control after 5 minutes
- **Reliability**: <1% crash rate during normal usage

### Technical Standards

- **Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, Safari (modern versions)
- **Dependencies**: Pinned stable versions, clear fallback strategies
- **Code Quality**: 80%+ test coverage, TypeScript strict mode
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and error tracking

## Non-Goals (Current Version)
