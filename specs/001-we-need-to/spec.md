# Feature Specification: OX Board Project Consolidation

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-need-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need to heavily consolidate this project. It's so unorganized. What i want is a gesture controlled stem player, allowing an everyday listener to easily import audio files, which are stem separated, and then either using keyboard controls or computer vision powered gestures to create their own tracks using their imports. I've gone through so many iterations, created so many things on top of it. It really needs to just be an incredible software, WITH THE POTENTIAL, BUT NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW, To later be monetized"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: consolidation need, gesture control, stem separation, everyday users
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: everyday listeners; Actions: import, separate, control, create; Data: audio files, stems
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: import ‚Üí separate ‚Üí control ‚Üí create tracks
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on core stem player functionality
6. Identify Key Entities: AudioFile, Stem, Track, GestureControl
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Focus on consolidation and simplification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

An everyday music listener wants to take their favorite songs and create personalized remixes by manipulating individual stems (vocals, drums, bass, instruments) using intuitive gesture controls or keyboard shortcuts. They should be able to import any audio file, have it automatically separated into stems, and then use natural hand gestures or simple keyboard controls to adjust volumes, apply effects, and create their own unique versions of the tracks.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has an audio file on their computer, **When** they import it into the application, **Then** the file is automatically separated into individual stems (vocals, drums, bass, instruments)

2. **Given** stems are loaded and playing, **When** the user performs a volume gesture with their hand, **Then** the corresponding stem volume adjusts in real-time

3. **Given** the user prefers keyboard controls, **When** they press designated keys, **Then** they can control stem volumes and effects without using gestures

4. **Given** the user has created a custom mix, **When** they choose to save their work, **Then** the application preserves their stem settings and allows playback of their creation

5. **Given** the user is new to the application, **When** they first launch it, **Then** they see a simple, uncluttered interface focused solely on stem player functionality

### Edge Cases

- What happens when audio file format is not supported for stem separation?
- How does system handle gesture recognition in poor lighting conditions?
- What occurs when stem separation fails or produces poor quality results?
- How does the application behave when computer vision camera is not available?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically separate imported audio files into individual stems (vocals, drums, bass, instruments)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide real-time gesture recognition for controlling stem volumes and effects
- **FR-003**: System MUST offer keyboard alternatives for all gesture-based controls
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to import common audio file formats [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific formats - MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time audio playback with low latency during stem manipulation
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to save and recall their custom stem configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST present a simplified, beginner-friendly interface without professional DJ complexity
- **FR-008**: System MUST work offline without requiring internet connectivity for core functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide visual feedback for gesture recognition status and accuracy
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to export their final mixed tracks [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output formats and quality settings?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain performance with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many simultaneous stems and what audio quality?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST gracefully fallback to keyboard-only mode when camera/gesture detection is unavailable
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve user preferences and settings between sessions
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear feedback when stem separation is processing
- **FR-015**: System MUST support monetization framework for future expansion without affecting core functionality

### Key Entities

- **AudioFile**: User-imported music file containing mixed audio, supports multiple formats, triggers automatic stem separation
- **Stem**: Individual audio component (vocals, drums, bass, instruments) extracted from AudioFile, controllable independently
- **GestureControl**: Hand gesture mapping to stem operations (volume, effects, muting), with real-time recognition and feedback
- **Track**: User's custom creation combining modified stems, saveable and exportable, represents final mixed output
- **UserSession**: Maintains preferences, saved tracks, and application state across usage sessions

## Consolidation Strategy

### Components to Remove/Simplify

The current project contains extensive professional DJ features that distract from the core vision:

- **Professional DJ Interface**: Remove complex mixer boards, crossfaders, and advanced DJ controls
- **AI Mixing Assistant**: Eliminate automated mixing suggestions that complicate the user experience
- **Multi-deck System**: Simplify to single-track focus for everyday listeners
- **Complex Effects Rack**: Reduce to essential effects that enhance stem manipulation
- **Professional Waveform Displays**: Replace with simplified visual feedback for gestures
- **Advanced Performance Analytics**: Remove professional metrics and monitoring
- **Tutorial Overlays**: Replace complex DJ tutorials with simple gesture learning

### Core Focus Areas

- **Gesture Recognition**: Maintain and optimize computer vision for intuitive control
- **Stem Separation**: Ensure high-quality audio separation is the foundation
- **Real-time Audio**: Preserve low-latency playback and manipulation
- **User-friendly Interface**: Design for music enthusiasts, not professional DJs
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure full functionality without gesture requirements

### Future Monetization Considerations

While not the current focus, the architecture should support:

- **Premium Stem Quality**: Higher resolution separation algorithms
- **Advanced Effects**: Professional-grade audio processing options
- **Cloud Storage**: Save and sync projects across devices
- **Collaboration Features**: Share and remix with other users
- **Export Options**: High-quality output formats and streaming integration
