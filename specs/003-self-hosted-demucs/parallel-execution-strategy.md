# Self-Hosted Demucs Parallel Execution Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive parallel execution strategy for replacing mock stem separation implementations with production-ready self-hosted Demucs backend. The strategy organizes work into five parallel tracks with defined dependencies, team structure, and execution timeline to minimize development time while ensuring quality and reliability.

**Total Timeline**: 8 weeks  
**Team Size**: 5-7 developers  
**Critical Path**: Backend Infrastructure → Core Processing → Frontend Integration → Testing & Validation

## 1. Dependency Analysis

### Current Mock Implementation Dependencies

**Critical Mock Components (100% Implementation Required):**

- `/api/stemify` - Returns silent audio URLs instead of real stems
- `DemucsProcessor.processStemSeparation()` - Frequency simulation only
- `/api/silent-audio` - Generates silent WAV files for demo
- Frontend service layer expects immediate synchronous responses

**Partial Mock Dependencies:**

- Waveform generation (algorithmic vs. real audio analysis)
- Progress tracking (fake progress vs. real job status)
- Error handling (generic errors vs. audio-specific failures)

### Sequential Dependencies (Must Be Done in Order)

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**

1. Backend infrastructure setup (Python, FastAPI, dependencies)
2. Basic Demucs model installation and configuration
3. Redis job queue implementation
4. Core file upload processing

**Phase 2: Core Processing (Week 2-3)**

1. YouTube download service implementation
2. Audio processing pipeline completion
3. Model selection and optimization
4. Job status tracking system

**Phase 3: Integration (Week 4-5)**

1. Frontend API service updates
2. Progress polling implementation
3. Error handling integration
4. Real-time UI updates

### Parallel Work Opportunities

**Independent Workstreams:**

- **#demucs-reviews**: Code and design reviews

### Decision Making Process

**Technical Decisions:**

- Architecture changes: Require Track A lead approval + cross-track review
- API contract changes: Require Track C lead approval + all track leads
- Testing strategy changes: Require Track D lead approval + affected tracks

**Priority Changes:**

- Task priority adjustments: Individual track leads can make decisions
- Cross-track priority conflicts: Escalate to project manager
- Resource reallocation: Weekly all-hands consensus required

## 7. Risk Mitigation for Parallel Work

### Code Merge Conflicts

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Feature Branching**: Each track maintains separate feature branches
- **Integration Branches**: Weekly integration branches for cross-track testing
- **Conflict Resolution Protocol**:
  1. Automated conflict detection in CI/CD
  2. Track leads collaborate on resolution
  3. All-hands review for complex conflicts
  4. Rollback plan for failed merges

**Prevention Measures:**

- Clear code ownership boundaries
- Regular cross-track code reviews
- Shared component documentation
- Integration testing before merges

### API Contract Mismatches

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Contract-First Development**: API contracts defined before implementation
- **Schema Validation**: Automated validation of request/response formats
- **Version Management**: Clear versioning for API changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility during transition

**Detection Methods:**

- Automated API testing in CI/CD
- Contract testing before deployment
- Integration testing for all endpoints
- Manual verification during weekly sync

### Resource Contention

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Environment Segregation**: Separate dev/staging/prod environments
- **Resource Quotas**: CPU/memory limits per track
- **Scheduling Coordination**: Track E manages shared resource allocation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time resource usage tracking

**Contention Scenarios:**

- GPU resource conflicts: Track A has priority, others use CPU fallback
- Database connections: Connection pooling with limits per track
- File storage: Separate directories per track with quotas
- Network bandwidth: CDN integration for audio file serving

### Testing Bottlenecks

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Parallel Test Execution**: Multiple test environments and CI/CD pipelines
- **Test Data Management**: Shared test data repository with versioning
- **Mock Services**: Comprehensive mocks for independent testing
- **Staged Testing**: Unit → Integration → End-to-end progression

**Quality Gates:**

- Code coverage requirements (80%+ for all tracks)
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Security scanning required before deployment
- Accessibility compliance validation

### Critical Path Dependencies

**Risk Identification:**

- Backend processing must be functional before frontend integration
- API contracts must be stable before client implementation
- Infrastructure must be ready before deployment testing

**Mitigation Approaches:**

- Buffer time in schedule for dependency delays
- Parallel development of dependent components where possible
- Early prototyping of critical path items
- Weekly dependency review and adjustment

This parallel execution strategy provides a comprehensive framework for multiple teams to work simultaneously on replacing mock stem separation with production-ready self-hosted Demucs functionality. The strategy minimizes development time through careful dependency management, clear communication channels, and robust risk mitigation approaches.

**Key Success Factors:**

1. Maintain clear separation of concerns between tracks
2. Regular integration testing and dependency validation
3. Proactive risk identification and mitigation
4. Flexible resource allocation based on progress
5. Continuous communication and coordination

**Estimated Timeline:** 8 weeks for complete implementation with parallel execution across all tracks.
