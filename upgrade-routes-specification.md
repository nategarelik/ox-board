# Upgrade Routes Organization Specification

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines a comprehensive restructuring of monetization elements into dedicated routes and sections, separating upgrade paths from the primary creative workflow while maintaining clear navigation and all existing functionality. The goal is to eliminate clutter from the main application interface while providing organized, contextual access to upgrade options.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues with Current Implementation

1. **Interface Clutter**: SubscriptionPlans component occupies significant real estate on the main dashboard
2. **Workflow Disruption**: UsageMetrics displays technical jargon in prominent sidebar position
3. **Aggressive Presentation**: High-contrast styling and prominent CTAs create visual noise
4. **Poor Organization**: All monetization elements are mixed with core functionality
5. **Limited Scalability**: No dedicated space for detailed upgrade flows or feature comparisons

### Current Route Structure

```
/app
├── page.tsx (main dashboard - cluttered with monetization)
├── layout.tsx (root layout)
└── api/ (API routes)
```

## Proposed Route Architecture

### New Route Hierarchy

```
/app
├── page.tsx (clean main dashboard - features only)
├── layout.tsx (root layout)
├── pricing/ (dedicated pricing section)
│   ├── page.tsx (main pricing overview)
│   ├── plans/ (detailed plan comparisons)
│   │   ├── page.tsx (side-by-side comparison)
│   │   ├── [tier]/page.tsx (individual plan details)
│   │   └── compare/page.tsx (feature matrix)

```

### Clean Main Experience Routes

```
/app
├── page.tsx (core features only)
├── mix/ (mixing interface)
│   ├── page.tsx (main mixer)
│   └── [trackId]/page.tsx (track-specific mixing)
├── create/ (content creation)
│   ├── page.tsx (generation interface)
│   └── [taskId]/page.tsx (task details)

## Navigation Strategy

### Primary Navigation Updates

**Main App Header**:

  ("Mix", "Create", "Library")
]; // Clean, feature-focused
// + Contextual "Upgrade" button when appropriate
```

**Contextual Upgrade Prompts**:

- Appears when user approaches limits
- Shows specific benefits they'll unlock
- Links directly to relevant upgrade route
- Easy to dismiss with "Maybe Later"

### Breadcrumb Navigation

```
Home > Pricing > Plans > Standard Plan
Home > Pricing > Upgrade > Standard
Home > Pricing > Account > Usage
```

### Cross-linking Strategy

- Feature restrictions link to specific plan benefits
- Export quality options link to pricing comparison
- Processing limits link to upgrade flows
- All links preserve user's current context

interface ContextualUpgradePromptProps {
  trigger: "limit_reached" | "feature_blocked" | "milestone_achieved";
  currentTier: SubscriptionTier;
  suggestedTier: SubscriptionTier;
  blockedFeature?: string;
  returnPath?: string; // Preserve user's current context
  dismissible?: boolean;
}
```

### UpgradeNavigation Component

interface UserProgressDisplayProps {
  tier: SubscriptionTier;
  achievements: Achievement[];
  progress: TierProgress;
  recommendations: UpgradeRecommendation[];
}

interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  unlockedAt: Date;
  category: "mixing" | "creation" | "collaboration";

5. **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators throughout upgrade flows

## Conclusion

This routing reorganization transforms the current cluttered, aggressive monetization approach into a clean, organized system that separates upgrade paths from core functionality while maintaining clear navigation and all existing capabilities. The new structure provides dedicated spaces for detailed pricing information, guided upgrade experiences, and comprehensive account management, resulting in a significantly improved user experience while preserving revenue opportunities.

The key innovation is the contextual navigation approach - users encounter upgrade options at natural decision points in their workflow, rather than having them dominate the interface. This creates a more respectful, user-centric monetization experience that supports both creative work and business objectives.
